	 <h3>Albums</h3>
	 <dl>
	     <dt>"What Could Go Wrong"</dt>
         <dd>This was the band's first album, released in 2016. The band's modest popularity is due to this album and Vinny's pre-established presence on a site called Twitch.</dd>
		 
	     <dt>"Blood Bagel"</dt>
         <dd>"Blood Bagel" can be calssified as an EP because it features five tracks. The titles are supposed to be humorous and the songs themselves were described as jokes. Rather than a serious album, this EP was made for fun.</dd>		 
	
         <dt>"Another Light"</dt>
		 <dd>This is the third and most current album from Red Vox. It is still being worked on, however songs are being released individually online until the full album is complete.</dd>
